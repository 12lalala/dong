  <h1>How to evaluate Shi Yigong?</h1>
  <p>After listening to several reports, most of them did not specifically listen to them, but just happened to be in
    his occasion. His views and speeches are shocking. These views are not only the political correctness of the
    scientific community and the college circles, but also the mainstream discourse of the society. I was shocked that
    he was still very proud when he spoke. I am even more shocked that other big cows have attached to the views of Shi.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two things are more impressive. Once in a cultural event on the detection of gravitational waves, the “Schoolmaster”
    was also present, and the moderator asked him to say two sentences. He deliberately resigned at first, and then
    began his long impromptu theory. The content of the talk involves the topic of a major chicken soup in the universe,
    and it is also linked to astronomy and basic physics. Shi is indeed more familiar with astronomy and astrophysics
    than most life science professors, but he is probably looking at popular science materials, so the descriptions in
    many places are obviously amateur. I listened to the explosion - just as I listened to any non-academic questions.
    However, after he finished speaking, it is natural that the host and the experts will be touted.

    The other time was his report on a non-academic type of videophone training conference, his experience in the United
    States, and his value-oriented guidance. What makes me particularly incomprehensible is that he dared to claim in
    the report that he was in the lab of Beijing and never let students write articles. He said that he still had to
    modify the things written by the students anyway, and it would be more troublesome to change them instead of writing
    them. So he always asked the students to prepare the data and write it himself. I think this kind of boss must also
    exist. However, if you sneak up on it, it is a bit shameful and almost brave; if you show it out, it really makes me
    doubt life. If a student grows into an independent PI, writing ability is his ability to eat. On the one hand, after
    graduating, no boss writes paper to you. On the other hand, your ability to grant must be tempered from the
    pro-automatic pen. There is a saying that Shilab students are all workers on the assembly line. After coming out,
    their academic ability is not strong. I also thought that I was a graduate of Tsinghua University.
  </p>
  <p>Shi’s early work was very good. The first time I heard about Shi Yigong, it was a piece of academic report that was
    put out by the teacher during class. That was when Shi was still at JHU that year, he returned to Zhejiang
    University to do the report. The clip taken by the teacher is about the structural analysis of Apoptosome, revealing
    cytochrome
         c is the key role in this. The work itself is indeed very attractive, and the stories behind several labs and
    generations of scholars who went on to succeed in the relay are also very touching. At that time, I can say that I
    am very fond of Shi. However, the Shi of the CryoEM era, the style of his work, I really can't appreciate where it
    is as a layman. Spliceosome is very high, but is it really worse than the ribosome that solved the structure long
    ago? Wang Tongren gentleman has educated us.
  </p>
  <p>Anyway, Shi can not see this, I will hide it in a few days. (Stakeholder: I can be a big peer with his big peers
    and get to know some of his little peers.
